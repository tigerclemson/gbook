:wave: **Hello!**

**BooGi** is an awesome [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org/) documentation :book:
starter. It generates modern documentation pages, which can serve as product
docs, tutorials, _API_ docs and, especially, knowledge-bases.

Goal is to give teams powerful tool which they can use to efficiently and
collaboratively share their knowledge. They can easily host it on any
infrastructure of choice or SaaS hosting like Netlify, Vercel or
GitHub / GitLab Pages. We want to provide a product, which can be customized
to (nearly) any needs, either using basic or advanced configuration options.

BooGi is inspired by popular [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) look and feel.
It offers custom styling and components that enable building beautiful documentation
for projects and products quickly. It follows docs-as-code principles, where
you treat your documentation in the same way as your code.

## What BooGi offers? :fire:
